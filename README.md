# Deploy preview environment using preevy

## About Preevy

Preevy is a powerful CLI tool designed to simplify the process of creating ephemeral preview environments.
Using Preevy, you can easily provision any [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) application using any Kubernetes server or affordable VMs on [AWS Lightsail](https://aws.amazon.com/free/compute/lightsail), [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/compute/) or [Azure VM](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/virtual-machines/).

Visit The full documentation here: https://preevy.dev/

## About the preevy-up action

Use this action to build and deploy a preview environment using the Preevy CLI whenever a GitHub PR is created or updated.

Preevy's [GitHub plugin](https://preevy.dev/github-plugin) will automatically add a comment to your PR with links to the deployed services.

More information about running Preevy from CI [over here](https://preevy.dev/ci/).

Use [preevy-down action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/preevy-down) to remove the preview environment when the PR is merged or closed.

## Permissions

Preevy requires the following [GitHub Actions permissions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/assigning-permissions-to-jobs):

* `contents: read`: used by Preevy to read the Docker Compose file(s)
* `pull-requests: write`: used by the Preevy GitHub plugin to write a comment with the deployed URLs on the PR

In addition, if you're using GitHub's OIDC Token endpoint to authenticate to your cloud provider (as in the below examples), `id-token: write`: is also needed.

## Inputs

### `profile-url`

*required*: `true`

The profile url created by the CLI, [as detailed in the docs](https://preevy.dev/ci/).

### `args`

*required*: `false`

Optional additional args to the `preevy up` command, see the full reference [here](https://preevy.dev/cli-reference/#preevy-up-service).

### `version`

*required*: `false`

The preevy [CLI version](https://www.npmjs.com/package/preevy?activeTab=versions) to use. Defaults to `latest`.

***Note*** Since `v2.1.0`, this action requires Preevy CLI version `v0.0.58` or newer. To use an older version of the CLI, use `livecycle/preevy-up-action@v2.0.0`.

### `docker-compose-yaml-paths`

*required*: `false`

Optional path to the `docker-compose.yaml` file. If not provided, uses the working directory. If you have multiple docker compose files, you can add them as a comma seperated string like so `'docker-compose.yml,docker-compose.dev.yml'`

### `release-type`

*required*: `false`

***EXPERIMENTAL***. Specify `gh-release` to install Preevy from a binary file, which is much faster than using NPM.

If this option is specified, `version` can be either `latest` or one of the [released versions](https://github.com/livecycle/preevy/releases). Canary versions are not supported.

### `node-cache`

*required*: `false`

Node package manager used for caching. Supported values: `npm`, `yarn`, `pnpm`, or ''. [Details](https://github.com/actions/setup-node/blob/main/docs/advanced-usage.md#caching-packages-data). Default: `npm`.

## Outputs

### `urls-json`

The generated preview environment urls, formatted in JSON.

## Examples

### Build and deploy on AWS Lightsail

The following features are shown:

* [Configuring AWS credentials](https://github.com/aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials) using GitHub's OIDC provider
* Creating a [GitHub environment URL](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment) with a specific service.

```yaml
name: Deploy Preevy environment
on:
  pull_request:
    types:
      - opened
      - reopened
      - synchronize
permissions:
  id-token: write
  contents: read

  # Needed to write a PR comment with the environment URLs
  pull-requests: write

    timeout-minutes: 15

    # allow a single job to run per PR
    concurrency: preevy-${{ github.event.number }}

      # An environment needs to be created at
      # https://github.com/YOUR-ORG/YOUR-REPO/settings/environments

      url: ${{ steps.store_url.outputs.url }}

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

      # Change `frontend` and `3000` in this step to your main service and port
      # This will appear as the GH environment URL
      - id: store_url
        name: Store URL of frontend
        run: |
          echo url=$(jq -r '.[] | select(.service=="frontend" and .port==3000).url' "${{ steps.preevy_up.outputs.urls-file }}") >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"
```

### Build on the CI machine with cache, deploy on a Google Cloud VM

The following features are shown:

* [Configuring Google Cloud credentials](https://github.com/google-github-actions/auth) using a Service Account JSON file
* [Offloading the build the CI machine](https://preevy.dev/recipes/faster-build#part-1-offload-the-build) by creating a BuildKit builder and specifying its name to the Preevy up action
* Using GitHub Packages (GitHub Container Registry, GHCR) as a [cache](https://preevy.dev/recipes/faster-build#part-2-automatically-configure-cache) to make the build faster across different PRs.
